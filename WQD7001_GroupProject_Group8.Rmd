<center><font size="20">*Introduction*</font></center>  
- According to International Diabetes Federation, approximately 463 million adult (20-79 years) were living in diabetes and the prevelence will increaed by 50% in 2045.<br/> 
<center><font size="25"><p style="color:red">**50% of diabetic people are not aware that they have diabetes**</p></font></center>
- A shiny app is developed to improve the level of awareness of diabetes among public.<br/>
- Factor of diabetes is visualized to have better understanding on the relationshinp between variables among diabetes and non-diabetes.<br/>
- A predictive model is developed to predict the probability of getting diabetes.<br/>
- A diabetes dataset of Women Pima Indian ethnic was taken as sample for our analysis.

1. Asking a question<br/>
    + What is the variable relationship between diabetic and non diabetic group?<br/>
    + What is the chances of getting diabates based on the predictive model we have built? <br/>
2. Getting data<br/>
    + The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. The dataset consists several medical predictor variables for diabetes. The dataset only include the             information of female for Pima Indian heritage.<br/>
    + Source: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database<br/>
3. Exploring the data<br/>
    + Visualize the data by using chart diagram<br/>
4. Model the data<br/>
    + Build a predictive model for diabetes<br/>
5. Presenting the result<br/>
    + The result is presented by using Shiny App<br/>

The first page illustrate the visualization of variables. The second page is for the prediction of diabetes.<br/><br/>

<center><font size="20">*Experience*</font></center><br/>   
- By using shiny app, we can visualize the relationship between variable of diabetes dataset in an interative manner.<br/><br/> 
- It is easy to use as does not need any knowledge of HTML or JavaScript to get started.<br/><br/> 
- The predictive model in the app is beneficial for people to predict the probability of getting diabetes.<br/><br/> 
- We hope to collect more data to reflect the diabetes condition of larger population and improve the reliability of our app.
